Welcome to my repository dedicated entirely to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Here, you'll find a compilation of projects, experiments, and implementations where I've employed CNNs to tackle a variety of tasks, 
primarily in the realm of image processing and computer vision. My work is underpinned by Python and leading deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.

**Content**

- **Code:** Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks detailing the architecture, design, and training of diverse CNN models. From basic CNN structures to more intricate architectures like ResNet, Inception, and MobileNet,
delve into the core of each implementation.
- **Datasets:** A collection of datasets sourced from renowned repositories and used in the CNN experiments. These cover a broad spectrum of domains, from facial recognition to object detection and image segmentation.
- **Figures:** Visual representations of model performances, filter visualizations, feature maps, and other pertinent diagrams that emerged during the model-building and evaluation process.

**Highlighted CNN Projects**

The repository showcases a multitude of applications and complexities associated with CNNs, including:

- Image Classification with CNNs.
- Transfer Learning experiments with pre-trained models.
